# Hangman Game

## Introduction

"Hangman" is a classic word-guessing game implemented in Bash. Players try to guess a hidden word letter by letter within a limited number of attempts. This game helps kids learn basic coding concepts such as arrays, loops, conditionals, and input/output.

## How to Play

1. Run the script.
2. Guess letters to uncover the hidden word.
3. You have up to 6 incorrect guesses before the game ends.
4. Enjoy testing your vocabulary and deduction skills!

## How to Run

1. Save the script to a file, for example, `hangman.sh`.
2. Open a terminal and navigate to the directory where the script is saved.
3. Make the script executable by running: `chmod +x hangman.sh`
4. Run the script by typing: `./hangman.sh`

## Learning Points

This game is designed to teach the following coding concepts:

- **Arrays**: Managing words for the game and guessed letters.
- **Loops**: Iterating through turns and checking conditions.
- **Conditionals**: Determining game outcomes based on player input.
- **Input/Output**: Handling user input and displaying game status.

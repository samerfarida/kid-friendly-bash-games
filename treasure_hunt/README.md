# Treasure Hunt Game

## Introduction

"Treasure Hunt" is an exciting game where players navigate through a grid to find hidden treasure. This game helps kids learn basic coding concepts such as arrays, loops, conditionals, and functions.

## How to Play

1. Run the script.
2. Enter row and column coordinates to search for the hidden treasure on the grid.
3. You have 3 attempts to find the treasure.
4. The game will inform you if you found the treasure or provide hints for the next attempt.

2. Open a terminal and navigate to the directory where the script is saved.
3. Make the script executable by running: `chmod +x treasure_hunt.sh`
4. Run the script by typing: `./treasure_hunt.sh`

## Learning Points

This game is designed to teach the following coding concepts:

- **Arrays**: Representing and navigating through a grid.
- **Loops**: Iterating through game logic and attempts.
- **Conditionals**: Checking for the presence of the treasure.
- **Functions**: Organizing game logic into reusable functions.

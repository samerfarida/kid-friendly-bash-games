# Word Scramble Game

## Introduction

"Word Scramble" is a fun game where players unscramble a shuffled word to guess the original word. This game helps kids learn basic coding concepts such as string manipulation, arrays, loops, and conditionals.

## How to Play

1. Run the script.
2. Unscramble the shuffled word displayed on the screen.
3. Enter your guess for the original word.
4. The game will inform you if your guess is correct or incorrect.

## How to Run

1. Save the script to a file, for example, `word_scramble.sh`.
2. Open a terminal and navigate to the directory where the script is saved.
3. Make the script executable by running: `chmod +x word_scramble.sh`
4. Run the script by typing: `./word_scramble.sh`

## Learning Points

This game is designed to teach the following coding concepts:

- **String manipulation**: Shuffling and unshuffling words.
- **Arrays**: Storing and accessing words for the game.
- **Loops**: Iterating through game logic.
- **Conditionals**: Checking if the player's guess is correct.

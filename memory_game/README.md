# Memory Game

## Introduction

"Memory Game" is a classic card-matching game implemented in Bash where players match pairs of hidden numbers. This game helps kids learn basic coding concepts such as arrays, loops, conditionals, and game logic.

## How to Play

1. Run the script.
2. Enter the coordinates of the first card to flip, e.g., `1 2`.
3. Enter the coordinates of the second card to flip, e.g., `3 4`.
4. The game will tell you if the cards match or not.
5. Keep flipping cards until you match all pairs.

## How to Run

1. Save the script to a file, for example, `memory_game.sh`.
2. Open a terminal and navigate to the directory where the script is saved.
3. Make the script executable by running: `chmod +x memory_game.sh`
4. Run the script by typing: `./memory_game.sh`

## Learning Points

This game is designed to teach the following coding concepts:

- **Arrays**: Storing the game board and the state of the cards.
- **Loops**: Iterating through the game until all pairs are matched.
- **Conditionals**: Checking if the selected cards match.
- **Input/Output**: Handling user input and displaying the game board.

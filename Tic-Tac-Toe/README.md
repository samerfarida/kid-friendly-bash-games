# Tic-Tac-Toe Game

## Introduction

"Tic-Tac-Toe" is a classic two-player game implemented in Bash where players take turns placing Xs and Os on a 3x3 grid, aiming to get three in a row. This game helps kids learn basic coding concepts such as 2D arrays, loops, conditionals, and input/output.

## How to Play

1. Run the script.
2. Players take turns entering coordinates to place their X or O on the grid.
3. The game will check for a winner after each move.
4. The first player to get three in a row horizontally, vertically, or diagonally wins!
5. Enjoy the game and challenge your friends!

## How to Run

1. Save the script to a file, for example, `tic_tac_toe.sh`.
2. Open a terminal and navigate to the directory where the script is saved.
3. Make the script executable by running: `chmod +x tic_tac_toe.sh`
4. Run the script by typing: `./tic_tac_toe.sh`

## Learning Points

This game is designed to teach the following coding concepts:

- **2D arrays**: Representing and manipulating the game board.
- **Loops**: Iterating through turns and checking game conditions.
- **Conditionals**: Checking for win conditions and valid moves.
- **Input/Output**: Handling user input and displaying the game board.

# Guess the Number Game

## Introduction

"Guess the Number" is a simple yet fun game implemented in Bash. Players try to guess a randomly selected number between 1 and 100. This game helps kids learn basic coding concepts such as variables, loops, conditionals, and input/output.

## How to Play

1. Run the script.
2. Enter your guess for the number.
3. The game will tell you if your guess is too high, too low, or correct.
4. Keep guessing until you find the correct number.

## How to Run

1. Save the script to a file, for example, `guess_the_number.sh`.
2. Open a terminal and navigate to the directory where the script is saved.
3. Make the script executable by running: `chmod +x guess_the_number.sh`
4. Run the script by typing: `./guess_the_number.sh`

## Learning Points

This game is designed to teach the following coding concepts:

- **Variables**: Storing the number to guess and player guesses.
- **Loops**: Iterating until the correct number is guessed.
- **Conditionals**: Checking if the guess is too high, too low, or correct.
- **Input/Output**: Handling user input and displaying feedback.
